# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* They are definitely good to avoid some syntax confusion, and give a guide for developers from different background.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Yes, because it created following people's logic of creating a website. It gives clear distinction of each funtion of the each layer.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Yes, it was more logically connect the elements, also shorter.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* Because some html elements have default styles.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* I have used chrome and ie. I don't like the fact that same website looks different in different browsers. It causes extra work for programmers.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
