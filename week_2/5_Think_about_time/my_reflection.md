My biggest time management challenge, not only during Phase 0, but always, is how to regulate my working and sleeping cycle. I often get excited by work or projects, and could work on it 2 or 3 days with little sleep. I could have this life style for a week long. However, when the project ends, I can't focus on anything the 2 or 3 days after it. I usually just playing around, and doing nothing for that two or three days. The worst problem is it mess up my sleeping cycle, and my health. To me, I could say break my work into pieces is something I have to do. Also, I have to get used to work early in the morning, instead of staying up late. I am now forcing myself to eat breakfast, and stop ordering pizza at mid-night. This would regulate my life. My overall plan is getting used to work early, and sleep early. If I could achive that, my efficiency would be much better! I could also save the money spent on mid-night pizza/wings!
