* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* The most important I know are the ways to to ux design. Like A/B testing, wireframing, feedback software, content inventory, prototyping applications. 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* I like it as it give dev a chance to think about how the design flow should be, what is user's habbit, what are the diffenrence of design on different device. 
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* I first draw the wireframe, then design the workflow of the site, then code it. 
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* I would like to make it more interactive, and more personalized based on users' browsing history. 
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
