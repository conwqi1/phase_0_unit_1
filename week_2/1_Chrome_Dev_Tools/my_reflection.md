# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* It is the programming interface for html and xml. It defines the relationship between elements. It is good as it gives user an overview/structure of the webpage they look into. It orgnize the elements in a pretty way, and neat structure.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* The wordpress.com sites contains tons of <script>s, and many <iframes>s in the elements.I am not sure what the real difference should be. This is what I found.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* It is really a helpful tool for developer. It makes things easy to check html, css for single element,instead of going back to the html/css file to find things you want. Also the speed test is good for developer. 
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* I bit confused when working with the speed, loading, network tests in the dev tools. Need to dig more into those concepts.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
