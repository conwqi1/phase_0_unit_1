* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. create a repository by clicking the new repository button and edit readme section, and choose a proper license. To clone it, use git clone yourssh command.
2. the open source means one could edit the program/software itself, and make changes to it. Like drupal, worldpress.
3. To me, Open Source is a great way to collect ideas from different people. 
4. Using a proper license could give others a clear idea how you want to distribute your program. What are the rights others have to edit, copy, or distribute your program could be specified with the liscence. It saves a dev's time to answer the question again and again.
5. It gave me a clear definition of open source, fifference between git and github, and how to use license. I spent some time on leanring the git command. It was a bit confusing at first point.
